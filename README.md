<h2> Introduction </h2>
Kickstarter, the crowdfunding platform, is thinking about providing a consulting service to project founders to help its customers create more successful crowdfunding campaigns. I was tasked to carry out data analysis and create a presentation that makes clear recommendations on how people can create a successful Kickstarter campaign.

<h2> Data Analytics Questions </h2>
1) Which project category had the highest success in reaching its funding goal?

<h2> Data Source </h2>
The dataset is scraped from early Kickstarter campaigns and uploaded on the repository for easy reference.
